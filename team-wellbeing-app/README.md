# Wellbeing Tracker - Enterprise Full-Stack Application

## Introduction
The Wellbeing Tracker is an enterprise-grade application designed to help users monitor and manage their mental health and wellbeing. This full-stack solution provides a secure, scalable platform for users to track their daily mental health status, mood patterns, and personal reflections.

## Solution Overview
The application implements a three-tier architecture:
- **Frontend**: React-based responsive UI with real-time updates
- **Middleware**: RESTful API service layer with Express.js
- **Backend**: MongoDB database with mongoose ODM

## Project Aim & Objectives

### Main Goal
To provide a secure and scalable platform for users to track and manage their mental wellbeing while maintaining data privacy and ensuring high performance.

### Key Objectives
1. Implement secure user authentication and authorization
2. Enable real-time data updates and synchronization
3. Ensure data privacy and GDPR compliance
4. Provide an intuitive, responsive user interface
5. Maintain high performance and scalability

## Enterprise Considerations

### Performance
- Implemented React.lazy() for code splitting
- Optimized database queries with proper indexing
- Added Redis caching layer for frequently accessed data
- Utilized CDN for static asset delivery
- Implemented client-side caching strategies

### Scalability
- Horizontally scalable architecture
- Containerized deployment with Docker
- Load balancing configuration
- Database sharding capability
- Microservices-ready architecture

### Robustness
- Comprehensive error handling
- Automatic retry mechanisms for failed operations
- Graceful degradation strategies
- Data validation at all layers
- Automated backup systems

### Security
- JWT-based authentication
- Password hashing using bcrypt
- CSRF protection
- XSS prevention
- Rate limiting
- Input sanitization
- Data encryption at rest and in transit

### Deployment
- Hosted on AWS (or your chosen platform)
- CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
- Environment-specific configurations
- Automated testing before deployment
- Zero-downtime deployment strategy
